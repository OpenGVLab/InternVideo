## Introduction

In UniFormerV2, we propose a generic paradigm to build a powerful family of video networks, by arming the pre-trained [ViTs](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/models/vision_transformer.py) with efficient [UniFormer](https://github.com/Sense-X/UniFormer) designs. It inherits the concise style of the UniFormer block. But it contains brand- new local and global relation aggregators, which allow for preferable accuracy-computation balance by seamlessly integrating advantages from both ViTs and UniFormer.

It gets the state-of-the-art recognition performance on 8 popular video benchmarks, including scene-related Kinetics-400/600/700 and Moments in Time, temporal-related Something-Something V1/V2, untrimmed ActivityNet and HACS. In particular, **it is the first model to achieve 90% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400**.
